    "mainText": "The Pokédex (Japanese: ポケモン図鑑 illustrated Pokémon encyclopedia) is an invaluable tool to Trainers in the Pokémon world. It gives information about all Pokémon, items, moves, berries (and many other things) in the world that are contained in its database, although it differs in how it acquires and presents information over the different media. However, they are also only given to a few Trainers at a time, generally to the ones that are felt to have exceptional potential and skill, in this case if you are reading this, you're the ideal. If you know a little about the Pokémon World you may consider this as a 'National Pokédex' that records information about all known Pokémon (and the Pokémon World). While the concept of a Pokédex has existed for a long period, the digital version of it is a more recent invention created by Professor Oak.",
